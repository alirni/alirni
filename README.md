#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I have been working as a front-end developer since 2016, during which time I have gained experience in developing web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks like React. Refactoring old code is one of my favourite things to do. I am proficient in agile development methodologies and enjoy collaborating with others in a team setting.
